		<h2>Feeling stressed out? You're not alone.</h2>
		<p>College can be fun, but it can also be tough to juggle school, work, family, and friends.</p>
		<p>Dallas College recognizes that you’re a whole person – not just a student. Your academic success depends on your personal development and emotional health.</p>
		<p>Our counselors are licensed professionals and are highly qualified specialists with master’s or doctoral degrees. They can help you identify, understand, and develop skills to resolve your educational, career, and personal issues, and they will assist you in learning how to find your pathway to college and workplace success.</p>
